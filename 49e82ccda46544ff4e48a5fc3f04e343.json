That prototype milkshake included just milk, crushed ice, \"a mixture of unknown ingredients,\" and \"a bit of any desired sirup,\" as the newspaper explained.\" Eventually, people started using ice cream and cookies, creating a real caloric bomb, albeit an irresistibly delicious one.</p>\n<p>Dieticians estimate Americans should break down their meal consumption throughout the day as follows: 300 to 400 calories for breakfast and 500 to 700 calories each for lunch and dinner, plus about 200 for snacks.</p>\n<p>Most people are more likely to overeat rather than undereat, so 24/7 Tempo reviewed the menus of more than a dozen chain restaurants to compile a list of milkshakes that exceeded 700 calories. Calorie counts were taken either from the nutritional information provided by the chain on its website or from <a href=\"https://www.nutrition-charts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrition Charts</a>, a food nutrition data site.</p>\n<p>Most places that make good shakes offer them in great variety, going beyond just the classic chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. Bits of cookie, candy, even cake get mixed into shakes, which significantly add to the total caloric amount.</p>\n<p>Shakes became popular in the 1950s. They can still be found in just about every burger joint or diner in America \u2014 <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/07/07/the-best-diner-in-every-state/\" target=\"_blank\">and this is the best diner in every state</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the milkshakes at popular fast-food operations actually fall below the 700 number \u2014 but largely due to their size. If people order the mini or small version, they will most likely consume a drink with 400 to 700 calories. But who orders a mini shake?</p>\n<p>Some shakes have calorie counts that not only exceed the standard for a single meal but come very close to the recommended intake for an entire day of about 2,000 calories. <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/07/30/how-long-you-need-to-exercise-to-burn-off-the-calories-from-your-favorite-foods/\" target=\"_blank\">This is how long you need to exercise to burn off the calories from your favorite foods</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/10/19/24-milkshakes-with-more-calories-than-an-entire-meal/2/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click here for 24 milkshakes with more calories than an entire meal</strong></a></p>\n<br/><p class=\"nc_attribution_text\">This article was written by 247patrick from <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/RyNm/~3/KahrIOq1jko/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">24/7 Wall St.</a> and was legally licensed through the <a href=\"https://www.industrydive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Dive</a> publisher network.

By measures from the World Bank, <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/march-2021-global-poverty-update-world-bank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poverty in America</a> is higher than in parts of Asia but much lower than in much of Africa. While there is no absolute method for determining poverty rates, there is one that is widely accepted.</p>\n<p>Gross national income, or GNI, is the sum of money earned by a country's population and businesses within a given year. It includes income earned by corporations or persons based in a given country but operating outside of its borders. GNI is a useful measure for determining the overall income of a country. The measure helps indicate which countries are the richest and the poorest in the world.</p>\n<p>To determine the poorest country in the world, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data on GNI per capita for 193 countries and special regions with available data from the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/home\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank</a>.</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the poorest countries in the world are located in Africa. The continent has long struggled with violent conflicts and political instability. Harvard University researchers Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson wrote in a paper on poverty in Africa that the continent struggles economically because \"property rights are insecure and very inefficiently organized, markets do not function well, states are weak, and political systems do not provide public goods.\" They added that these \"dysfunctional dynamics were then further reinforced by colonialism\" when other countries extracted resources from Africa.<br/>\nEven though some of these African countries have enough natural resources, like oil and gold, to lift incomes, much of the wealth goes to a select few at the top of the political system, leaving much of the population in poverty.</p>\n<p>Burundi is the poorest country in the world. Here are the details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GNI per capita: $780</li>\n<li>2020 GDP: $3.3 billion</li>\n<li>Life expectancy: 61.6 years</li>\n<li>Population: 11.9 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Burundi/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Burundi</a> is a landlocked country in East Africa. It is by far the poorest country in the world, with a GNI per capita that is a fraction of the worldwide figure of $17,535.</p>\n<p>In most of the wealthiest countries, a large percentage of the gross domestic product comes from exports, typically well beyond the 29.5% average for all countries. Yet Burundi's exports make up just 5.0% of its GDP, the lowest share of any country. More than 86% of Burundi's residents live in rural areas, the second-highest share among countries. Agriculture and related industries account for 28.5% of Burundi's $3.3 billion GDP. Worldwide, agriculture makes up just 3.5% of all economic output.</p>\n<p>The World Bank estimates GNI per capita using the purchasing power parity method, and figures are in current international dollars. All data on GNI per capita is based on the most recent available year for a given country.</p>\n<p>Additional data on GDP in current U.S. dollars, population, life expectancy at birth and access to electricity also came from the World Bank. All data is for the most recent year available for each country.</p>\n<p>We also considered data on public sector corruption in 2020 from the nonprofit, international watchdog and anti-corruption group Transparency International.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/10/12/the-poorest-countries-in-the-world-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click here to read about all the poorest countries in the world.</strong></a><br/></p>\n<p>Get Our Free Investment Newsletter</p>\n<br/><p class=\"nc_attribution_text\">This article was written by Douglas A.

The pace has accelerated recently as older Americans have weighed the risks of working during the novel coronavirus pandemic, and decided it was an ideal time to bow out of the labor force. (Let's hope they considered at least some of these <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/03/11/27-ugly-truths-about-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\">27 ugly truths about retirement</a>.)</p>\n<p>According to an analysis of government data by the Pew Research Center, the number of Boomers who reported they were out of the labor force due to retirement rose by a record 3.2 million last year, more than double the number in 2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of August 2021, the U.S. Social Security Administration reported that there are about 46.9 million retired workers in the United States, making up about 14% of the total population (not counting U.S. territories or the District of Columbia). The distribution of these retired workers is, of course, not evenly divided between the states. The share of retired workers in each state ranges between 9.6% and 18.7%. (Washington D.C. has the lowest share \u2014 excluding. territories \u2014 with only 8.6% of its population retired.)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>To determine the number of retired people in every state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the U.S. Social Security Administration on the total number of retired workers by state for December 2020. Population figures used in calculating percentages came from U.S. Census Bureau data for 2019.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the size of a state's population doesn't correlate with its share of retirees. For instance, California and Texas, the top two most populous states, have about 7.6 million retirees between them, but both states rank near the bottom in their percentage of retirees. The country's third-most populous state, Florida, on the other hand, ranks near the top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/10/20/number-of-retired-people-in-every-state/2/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click here to see the number of retired people in every state</strong></a></p>\n<p>Climate doesn't appear to be a factor, either. The lure of mild to hot year-round weather is often cited as an attractive draw for older Americans, but the top four states with the largest shares of retirees are located at or near the Canadian border, while Wisconsin and New Hampshire are in the top 10.

But this is a big country and fishing conditions vary enormously from state to state: Some have thousands of rivers and lakes and/or many miles of seashore, while others are largely desert; some have vibrant fishing communities while in some, angling is an afterthought. Even the cost of fishing licenses and related essentials is different\u00a0 from one place to another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To determine the 25 best states for anglers, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the results of <a href=\"https://lawnlove.com/blog/best-worst-states-for-fishing/\" target=\"_blank\">a study by the lawn care marketplace Lawn Love,</a> ranking the fishing environment in all 50 for 2021. In compiling the study, the site considered 11 relevant metrics in four categories: the size of each state's fishing community, access to fishing grounds, cost of licenses and such, and availability of supplies. In compiling the data, Lawn Love drew on information supplied by five primary sources: <a href=\"https://www.basspro.com/shop/en\" target=\"_blank\">Bass Pro Shops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cabelas.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cabela's</a>, <a href=\"http://www.diskssportinggoods.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dick's Sporting Goods</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fieldandstream.com\" target=\"_blank\">Field &amp; Stream</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.scheels.com\" target=\"_blank\">Scheels</a>.</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise to learn that Alaska, which is almost synonymous with salmon, is the No. 1 state for fishing. It's also the largest state and, according to the Official Alaska State Website, has more than 3,000 rivers (including the Yukon, the third longest river in the country) and a whopping three million lakes. The state also boasts 6,640 miles of coastline and, including islands, almost 34,000 miles of shoreline. Alaska is also No. 1 for involvement, based on metrics such as fishing licenses issued per capita, number of fishing competitions, and number of fishing charters and guides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Michigan ranks No. 2 and again this should come as no surprise. Even though it's an inland state, it's the one most covered by water, is surrounded by four of the five Great Lakes, and boasts the longest freshwater coastline in the world. In total Michigan has nearly 65,000 lakes and ponds, which means great access to fishing.

This large, nationwide, Danish cohort study found no increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in children exposed to labour epidural analgesia compared to those without exposure.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Evidence Rating Level:</strong> 2 (Good)</p>\n<p><strong>Study Rundown:</strong> A recent study observed an increased incidence of autism in children born from mothers who received labour epidural analgesia compared to those born without epidural analgesia. This nationwide Danish cohort study, including all live-born children from January 1, 2006, until December 31, 2013, investigated whether there was an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children following administration of labour epidural analgesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of ASD. Follow-up began after the child-first birthday. Among 479 178 eligible children, 92 900 (19.4%) were exposed to labour epidural analgesia. The median follow-up was 7.0 years (IQR: 4.9-9.0). Some baseline characteristics differed between mothers who received labour epidural versus no labour epidural analgesia; therefore, adjusted analyses were presented. The incidence rate of ASD was 23.1 per 10 000 person-years in children exposed to labour epidural analgesia compared to 18.5 per 10 000 person-years in those without exposure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05 [95% CI: 0.98-1.11]). Furthermore, a within-mother analysis design was explored using children of mothers with more than one delivery who had both exposure and no exposure to labour epidural analgesia. There were 59 154 children included in this analysis and similarly found no association of ASD from exposure to labour epidural analgesia (exposed incidence rate: 20.8 per 10 000 person-years; unexposed incidence rate: 17.1 per 10 000 person-years; adjusted HR: 1.05 [95% CI: 0.90-1.21]). Overall, in contrast to a recent study, the incidence of ASD was not increased among children exposed to labour epidural analgesia. One limitation of this study, however, is that ASD can be misclassified or diagnosed later in life. Follow-up for this study was adequate (median: 7 years); however, it is critical to consider that some children can be diagnosed later in their adolescent years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2784508?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;utm_content=jama.2021.12655\" rel=\"noopener\">Click to read the study in JAMA</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2784524\" rel=\"noopener\">Click to read an accompanying editorial in JAMA</a></p>\n<p><strong>Relevant Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2771634?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;utm_content=jama.2021.12655\" rel=\"noopener\">Association between epidural analgesia during labor and risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring</a></p>\n<p><em>Image: PD</em></p>\n<p>\u00a92021 <a href=\"http://www.2minutemedicine.com\">2 Minute Medicine, Inc</a>.

While no evidence was available for the vaccine\u2019s efficacy against severe B.1.351 infection, this study suggests that second-generation COVID-19 vaccines may be needed to protect against this new variant. This study provides strong justification for using the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine in populations without the new B.1.351 variant. A major limitation of this study is its inability to establish the efficacy of the vaccine against severe covid-19 infection caused by the B.1.351 variant.

Adults between the ages of 18 and 65 with no or well-managed prior comorbidities were eligible for participation in the trial. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), previous COVID-19 infection, a history of anaphylaxis after vaccination, and obesity were excluded from the study. Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either the ChAdOx1 nCovid-19 vaccine or placebo, respectively. The primary endpoint was symptomatic COVID-19 infection after two weeks following the second injection confirmed by PCR testing. The study also aimed to investigate the efficacy of the vaccine against the new B.1.351 variant. There were 42 cases of mild and moderate COVID-19 infection confirmed, of which 39 cases were caused by the B.1.351 variant. Vaccine recipients accounted for 19 (2.5%) of these infections, while placebo recipients made up the remaining 23 (3.2%) cases. The study revealed a 75.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7 to 95.5) for the prevention of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection caused by non-B.1.351 variant two weeks after just a single injection. However, vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant was determined to be 10.4% (95% CI, -76.8 to 54.8). The study concluded that the ChAdOx1 nCovid-19 vaccine does not protect against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection caused by the B.1.351 variant. No conclusion was possible on vaccine prevention of severe COVID-19 infection caused by the B.1.351 variant.</p>\n<p><em>Image: PD</em></p>\n<p>\u00a92021 <a href=\"http://www.2minutemedicine.com\">2 Minute Medicine, Inc</a>.

Five-day treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children was comparable to standard, 10-day treatment.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Evidence Rating Level:</strong> 2 (Good)</p>\n<p>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common presenting illness among children. Due to the high occurrence, it is important to understand the most appropriate treatment for CAP among this age group. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of brief, high-dose amoxicillin (5 days) and standard high-dose amoxicillin treatment (10 days). The Short-Course Antimicrobial Therapy and Pediatric Respiratory Infections (SAFER) study was a two-center, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial. This included a single-center pilot study from December 2012 to March 31, 2014 and a follow-up main study from August 2016 to December 31, 2019 at two Canadian hospital emergency departments. Children were required to be between the ages of 6 months and 10 years and had a fever within 48 hours, respiratory symptoms, chest radiography-confirming pneumonia, and a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. Exclusions included the need for hospitalization, previous \u03b2-lactam antibiotic therapy, and comorbidities that predispose children to severe disease/pneumonia. A total of 281 participants (median [IQR] age = 2.6 [1.6 to 4.9], 42.3% female) were randomly assigned to either 5 days high-dose amoxicillin plus 5 days of placebo (intervention) or 5 days high-dose amoxicillin plus 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin or another formulation (control). In per-protocol analyses, pneumonia was cured in 88.6% of intervention participants compared to 90.8% of the control group (risk difference -0.016, 97.5% confidence limit -0.087). Clinical cure at 2-3 weeks occurred in 85.7% of the intervention group compared to 84.1% of the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference 0.023, 97.5% confidence limit -0.061). Overall, this study found that short-course (5-day) antibiotic treatment is comparable to standard care for children with CAP who did not require hospitalization. This sample was composed of children who were otherwise healthy, such that results may vary among more complex cases. However, clinical recommendations should take these results into consideration when treating CAP.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.120.019341\">Sex differences in ischemic stroke outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension</a></p>\n<p><strong>1.

However, little is known about the impact of PH on acute ischemic stroke outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the association between PH and adverse in-hospital outcomes following acute ischemic stroke, as well as potential sex differences among this sample. Admissions data for acute ischemic stroke were retrieved from the US National Inpatient Sample between October 2015 and December 2017. A total of 1,106,045 (median [IQR] age = 72 [61 to 82] years, 50.41% female) participants were included in analyses. The median length of stay was 3 days (IQR 2 to 6). The 31,830 (2.88%) participants with PH, compared to those without PH, were significantly older (median age = 80, difference 9 years) and were more likely to be female (difference 14.67%). Participants with PH were more likely to have co-occurring atrial fibrillation (difference 32.25%). Participants with PH were also more likely to receive revascularization therapies such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. PH was not found to be associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) but it was associated with increased odds of prolonged hospitalization of greater than four days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.22). PH was also associated with decreased odds of routine discharge for both males and females (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94). Compared to younger participants, older persons with PH were less likely to be discharged routinely (<em>p</em> = 0.028) and men with PH were 31% more likely to die while in the hospital than their female counterparts (<em>p</em> = 0.024). Overall, this study found that PH was not associated with in-hospital mortality, though factors such as gender impact these outcomes. Further, PH is associated with prolonged hospitalization (&gt;4 days) and adverse discharge status.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-01914-9\">Effects of maternal folic acid supplementation during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy on neurocognitive development in the child</a></p>\n<p><strong>1. Children of mothers who supplemented with folic acid (FA) during the second and third trimesters demonstrated greater processing speed at 11 years of age.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. FA supplementation in later pregnancy resulted in stronger verbal comprehension skills among females.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Evidence Rating Level:</strong> 2 (Good)</p>\n<p>Folic acid (FA) has been shown to prevent neural tube defects (NTD) when supplementation occurs before and during early pregnancy. This study investigated the benefits of continued FA supplementation through the second and third trimesters and its impact on neurocognitive performance in children. Included participants were followed up at 11 years of age from the randomized trial of Folic Acid Supplementation in the Second and Third Trimesters (FASSTT) in pregnancy. They were randomly assigned to be given 400 \u03bcg/day FA or placebo beginning in the 14<sup>th</sup> gestational week. Cognitive performance was measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children in the following domains: Full Scale IQ, Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain imaging was used to assess neuronal function. Of 119 mother-child pairs in the FASSTT trial, the cognitive performance of 68 children was assessed at the 11-year follow-up. A total of 31 were in the placebo group (M age = 28.1 years, 95% CI 26.6 to 29.6, 52% female) and 37 were in the FA group (M age = 29.7 years, 95% CI 28.5 to 30.8, 59.8% female). Children of mothers in the FA group scored significantly higher on two Processing Speed tests: Symbol Search (mean difference 2.9, 95% CI 0.3 to 5.5, <em>p</em> = 0.03) and Cancellation (mean difference 11.3, 95% CI 2.5 to 20.1, <em>p</em> = 0.04). Verbal Comprehension was higher in the FA group as well, but only for females (mean difference 6.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.8, <em>p</em> = 0.03). MEG assessment with a language tasks demonstrated more efficient semantic processing based on increased power at the High Gamma (49-70 Hz, <em>p</em> = 0.04) and Beta (13-30 Hz, <em>p</em> = 0.01) bands in children from the FA group. Overall, this study found that FA supplementation continues to benefit children when undergone in the second and third trimesters, with cognitive abilities proving stronger in multiple domains into the eleventh year of life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01292-y\">Attributes and predictors of long COVID</a></p>\n<p><strong>1. Those testing positive for COVID-19 and experiencing five or more symptoms during the first week had greater odds of having a symptom duration longer than 28 days (long COVID).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. The most predictive symptoms of long COVID were fatigue, headache, dyspnea, hoarse voice, and myalgia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Among individuals \u226570 years of age, anosmia was the strongest predictor of long COVID.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Evidence Rating Level:</strong> 3 (Average)</p>\n<p>The effects of COVID-19 are being studied in great detail to determine the risk factors of serious illness and death. One heterogeneous factor in COVID-19 is symptom duration, which is underrepresented in research among the general population. The term \u2018long COVID\u2019 (LC28) has been defined as symptoms persisting for over 28 days while \u2018short COVID\u2019 refers to less than 10 days. This prospective observational cohort study of COVID-19 symptoms used data from users of the COVID Symptom Study. These individuals reported testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and used the app to report when their symptoms subsided. These participants were then compared to symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2-negative controls matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Between March 24, 2020 and September 2020, 4,223,955 adults registered with the app (M [SD] age = 45.97 [15.8] years, 57% female, 88.2% United Kingdom). A total of 4,182 participants testing positive met eligibility criteria and were included in subsequent analyses with their matched controls. A total of 13.3% reported LC28, 4.5% reported symptoms for \u22658 weeks, and 2.3% reported symptoms for &gt;12 weeks. LC28 was commonly associated with headache (OR = 2.62, 95% CI 2.04 to 3.37), fatigue (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 2.09 to 3.83), myalgia (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.73), hoarse voice (OR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.90), and dyspnea (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.91 to 2.91), exacerbated by older age, female sex, and elevated BMI. LC28 was associated with experiencing more than five symptoms in the first week of illness (OR = 3.53, 95% CI 2.76 to 4.50). In older adults (\u226570 years), anosmia was the most predictive symptom of LC28 (OR 7.35, 95% CI 1.58 to 34.22). Those with LC28 were also more likely to report symptom relapses than those with a duration of &lt;28 days (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.0005). Investigators then used a simple model to determine the differences between short and long COVID at 7 days (n = 2,149). This model showed an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 76%, such that it could be utilized to identify symptomatic patients at risk for long COVID. Overall, this study suggests specific symptoms associated with long COVID and has demonstrated risk factors as well as the ability to predict who may be at greatest risk based on symptom duration. This information could guide clinical decisions for prevention and treatment of adults at risk for COVID-19.</p>\n<p><em>Image: PD</em></p>\n<p>\u00a92020 <a href=\"http://www.2minutemedicine.com\">2 Minute Medicine, Inc</a>.
